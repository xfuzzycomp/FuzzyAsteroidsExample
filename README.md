# FuzzyAsteroidsExample

This repository holds the example code needed for the 2021 University of Cincinnati Fuzzy Challenge.

## The Challenge

AI agents will be developed using Machine Learning algorithms and Fuzzy Inference Systems in the game/environment provided. For Spring 2021, the game will be a version of the classic arcade game "Asteroid" where the player/agent controls a vehicle that can move and fire at asteroids around them.

Further details on the competition aspect of the challenge will be decided soon.

## Getting Started

1. Install a Python interpreter (with pip), make sure the Python executable is on your System PATH. 
[Download Python here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install GIT on your computer [Download GIT here.](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Install your preferred IDE (see below.)
4. Connect GIT + Python to your IDE (follow the directions for your specific IDE)
5. We have set this repository to be a template, meaning you can easily copy everything in this repository
   as a separate repository. Click on the green "Use this template" and follow the prompts to create your own
   repository.
6. After configuring your repository, clone it through your GIT (Graphical User Interface or command line)

    ```git clone REPOSTORY_URL```

7. In the command line (while inside the directory you cloned to), run the following command

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

8. Now you should be able to run Asteroid Smasher!

## Updating the FuzzyAsteroids environment

We may make occasional improvements to the FuzzyAsteroids environment and will push to this repository. 
[https://github.com/xfuzzycomp/FuzzyAsteroids](https://github.com/xfuzzycomp/FuzzyAsteroids)

If you wish to upgrade ALL of your project dependencies, you can use the following command. 

    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

If you wish to upgrade ONLY the Fuzzy Asteroids environment, you can also do the following

    pip install --upgrade fuzzy_asteroids
